# Rick and Morty App | ricknmortapp

This Rick and Morty web app is a project made to showcase the use of [**The Rick and Morty API**](https://rickandmortyapi.com/). It was my first hands on fully React personal app since I worked with it in other work projects but nothing I can show at in my personal portfolio. This wiki-ish app was made using all the power that React can bring, I'll describe in the next lines the technologies I used.

## Features & libraries

This is a full frontend app made with react so I was bound to use some of the tools crafted for specific purposes, I wanted this to be as simple as possible in terms of libraries added and what brings to the table. I needed to manage the global state, make API requests and to have a dark mode toggle switch, other than that I just wanted it to make it pretty. Here's the list:

 - **Vite:** I needed a nice and easy dev environment, hot reload and commodity.
 - **Redux Toolkit:** We all know Redux, I needed a hassle free state management to control things like the dark mode toggle state.
 - **React Router:** Self explanatory.
  - **React Icons:** Nice and centralized place to get multiple Icons, [take a look here](https://react-icons.github.io/).
  - **TailwindCSS:** I find it easier to style my components if I do it by myself.
  -  **HeadlessUI:** I used it only in the Navbar, sometimes using nicely made wrappers it's a go. [Check it here](https://headlessui.com/)
